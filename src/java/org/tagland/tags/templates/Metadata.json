												#You add up all the characters in a document, in a giant, uppercased, squozen string.
												# Any punctuation is skipped. Then the search string, being the word you are looking for,
												# is searched for, and resulting finds are matched in in a fuzzy way to the sum of
												#    LeadingChars+SEARCH+TrailingChars
												# this fuzzy search lines up the two strings and assigns some sort of bucket weight for 
												# each letter:
												THEQUICKBROWNFOXJUMPSOVERTHELAZYDOG												
												THESNIKBROWNFOXJUMPSOVERALAZYDOG
												# humans probably do this by a pair of siding
